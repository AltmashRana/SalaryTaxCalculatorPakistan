# WealthFlow | Salary Tool (FY 2026)

This is a browser-based utility designed to calculate monthly and annual tax liabilities for salaried individuals in Pakistan. It is updated with the tax slabs for the 2026 fiscal year but allows users to adjust these brackets manually if regulations change.

## Key Features

* **Automatic Salary Breakdown**: If you only know your total gross salary, the tool can automatically generate an optimized split between Basic Salary, House Rent, Utilities, and Medical allowances.
* **Tax Slab Customization**: The tax brackets are pre-set based on current projections, but all rates and thresholds are editable to keep the tool relevant as laws update.
* **Provident Fund Logic**: Calculates both Employer and Employee contributions based on a percentage of the basic salary.
* **Exemptions**: Accounts for tax-exempt components like certain work expenses and medical allowances.
* **Currency Conversion**: Provides a real-time conversion of take-home pay into USD based on a user-defined exchange rate.

## Technical Details

The tool is built as a single-file application using standard web technologies:

* **HTML5/CSS3**: Handles the layout and responsive design.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: Manages the calculation logic and DOM updates without any external dependencies or libraries.

### Calculation Logic

The tax calculation follows the standard progressive slab system used by the FBR. The "Generate" function uses common payroll industry standards (e.g., Basic Salary at roughly 60% of gross) to create a plausible breakdown for those who do not have their specific payroll details on hand.

## Privacy and Data

This tool is strictly client-side. No salary data is transmitted to a server, and no information is stored outside of your own browser's temporary session. It is safe for use with sensitive financial figures.
